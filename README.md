Team Nostradamus' Repo for AngelHack Manipal 2016

This project aims to provide data for predicting the movement of a stock. Currently NASDAQ/DOW stocks are tested for support, but all stocks served by Yahoo Finance API should work.

To set up the database, import financial.php to your localhost server. Change config.php in folder php as required.

Open index.php. You can login with username:admin and password:admin, create a new account or skip sign in.

If you want to try the toolbox without setting up php, just open stocks.html and make sure js folder is downloaded. The UI is slightly outdated in this fie though.
